# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add nerdctl
# or
asdf plugin add nerdctl https://github.com/tyler-eon/asdf-nerdctl.git
```

Once the plugin is added, find a version and install it.

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all nerdctl

# Install specific version
asdf install nerdctl latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global nerdctl latest

# Now nerdctl commands are available
nerdctl version
```

After installing a new version, you need to run `containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh` to ensure your environment is set up appropriately. If you are having trouble with the installation or `nerdctl` is failing for some reason, try look at this [Getting Started](https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/containerd/) guide.

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to install & manage versions.
